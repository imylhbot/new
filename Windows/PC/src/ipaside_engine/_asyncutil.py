"""Small async helpers shared across the engine.

pymobiledevice3 10.x is asyncio-based, but several call sites have shifted
between sync and async across releases. ``maybe_await`` lets the rest of the
engine treat both shapes uniformly, and ``run`` gives synchronous callers
(the CLI, and the desktop shell over stdio) a simple entry point.
